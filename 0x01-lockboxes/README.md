# Lockboxes

This is a Python programming task that involves writing a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if all boxes can be opened. Each box may contain keys to the other boxes, and a key with the same number as a box opens that box. The first box is always unlocked. The function should return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else `False`.
